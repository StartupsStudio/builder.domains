# StoryBrand Framework: Builder Domains

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Builder, Developer, or AI Agent who needs to launch projects quickly without domain friction.

**What do they want?**

- Launch projects instantly without domain registration delays
- Skip DNS configuration complexity
- No credit card or payment required to start
- Professional-looking URLs for demos, prototypes, and MVPs
- Programmatic domain management for AI-driven workflows

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)

"I just want to ship my project, but I have to stop and deal with domain registration, DNS records, SSL certificates, and propagation delays."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)

"Every time I need a domain, it breaks my flow. I lose momentum on the actual work while fighting with registrars and DNS settings."

### Philosophical Problem

In an age where code can be deployed in seconds, domain setup shouldn't take hours. Infrastructure should accelerate builders, not slow them down.

### The Villain

**Domain Friction** — The unnecessary complexity of traditional domain registration, DNS management, and the artificial scarcity that makes builders pay for something that should be instant.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built a domain infrastructure designed for the speed of modern development and AI agents.

**Empathy:** We've launched hundreds of projects and felt the frustration of domain setup every single time.

**Authority:**

- Instant provisioning with no manual DNS
- Automatic SSL certificates
- API-first design for programmatic access
- Integration with startup-builder ecosystem

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Claim Your Domain

Pick a subdomain on our builder-friendly TLDs—instantly, no registration required.

```typescript
import { Domain } from 'builder.domains'

const domain = await Domain.claim({
  name: 'myproject',
  tld: 'build'  // myproject.build
})
```

### Step 2: Connect Your Project

Point to your deployment with a single line—Vercel, Netlify, Railway, or any custom endpoint.

```typescript
await domain.connect({
  target: 'my-project.vercel.app',
  ssl: true
})
```

### Step 3: Build and Ship

Your domain is live. Go back to building.

```typescript
console.log(domain.url)  // https://myproject.build
```

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Get Your Domain → `npx builder.domains claim myproject`

**Transitional CTA:** Browse available TLDs at builder.domains

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**

- Launch projects in minutes, not hours
- Ship demos and prototypes with professional URLs
- AI agents autonomously provisioning domains for new startups
- Zero friction from idea to live URL
- Focus on building, not infrastructure

**Transformation:**

From: Spending hours on domain setup for every project
To: Instant, free domains that just work

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**

- Momentum killed by domain registration flow
- Projects stuck with ugly deployment URLs
- Paying for domains you'll use once for a demo
- AI workflows blocked by manual domain steps
- DNS propagation delays killing launch timing

## 8. Brand Identity

**Voice:** Simple, fast, builder-focused

**Tone:** Direct, helpful, no-nonsense

**Key Messages:**

1. "Free domains. Instant setup. Zero friction."
2. "Ship your project, not DNS records."
3. "Built for builders. Built for AI."
