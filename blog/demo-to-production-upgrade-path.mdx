# From Demo to Production: The Upgrade Path from Free to Custom Domains

Every successful product starts as an experiment. Builder.domains provides free domains for experimentation, but when should you upgrade to a custom domain? More importantly, how do you upgrade without breaking your existing users?

## The Validation Journey

```
Idea → Demo (free) → Beta (free) → Launch (consider upgrade) → Growth (upgrade) → Scale (custom)
```

### Stage 1: Idea/Demo

**Use: Free builder.domains subdomain**

```bash
$ builder-domains claim my-app-demo

✓ Live at: https://my-app-demo.build
```

**Why free is perfect:**
- Zero commitment
- Instant setup
- Share with early testers
- Validate concept quickly

**Don't upgrade yet if:**
- No users yet
- Still iterating rapidly
- Unclear product-market fit
- Haven't monetized

### Stage 2: Beta/MVP

**Use: Free builder.domains subdomain**

```bash
$ builder-domains claim my-app

✓ Live at: https://my-app.build
```

**Why still free:**
- Focus on product, not branding
- Easy to pivot
- Users expect beta domains
- Save money for development

**Don't upgrade yet if:**
- < 100 active users
- No revenue
- High churn rate
- Frequent major changes

### Stage 3: Launch

**Consider: Custom domain**

```bash
$ builder-domains upgrade my-app --to myapp.com

✓ Custom domain: https://myapp.com
✓ Redirects: my-app.build → myapp.com
✓ SSL: Automatically migrated
```

**Upgrade signals:**
- First paying customers
- 100+ active users
- Stable feature set
- Ready for marketing push
- Professional image matters

**Cost/benefit analysis:**
```javascript
const launchMetrics = {
  users: 150,
  revenue: 500, // monthly
  customDomainCost: 12, // annual
  brandingValue: 'high',
  decision: 'UPGRADE'
};
```

### Stage 4: Growth

**Use: Custom domain**

**Why upgrade is essential:**
- Credibility with customers
- Easier to remember
- Better SEO
- Email addresses (hello@myapp.com)
- Professional contracts

**Typical upgrade timing:**
```typescript
interface UpgradeSignals {
  revenue: number;        // > $1000/month
  users: number;          // > 500 active
  team: number;           // > 1 person
  retention: number;      // > 40%
  raised_funding: boolean; // Any funding
}

function shouldUpgrade(signals: UpgradeSignals): boolean {
  return (
    signals.revenue > 1000 ||
    signals.users > 500 ||
    signals.team > 1 ||
    signals.raised_funding
  );
}
```

### Stage 5: Scale

**Use: Custom domain + infrastructure**

```bash
$ builder-domains upgrade my-app --to myapp.com --plan enterprise

✓ Custom domain: https://myapp.com
✓ SLA: 99.99% uptime
✓ Dedicated support
✓ Advanced analytics
✓ Priority DNS
```

**Enterprise features needed:**
- High traffic (> 1M requests/month)
- Enterprise customers require SLA
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced security requirements
- Compliance certifications

## The Upgrade Process

### Step 1: Plan the Migration

```typescript
class UpgradePlanner {
  async planUpgrade(currentDomain: string, targetDomain: string) {
    // Analyze current usage
    const analysis = await builderDomains.analyzeDomain(currentDomain);

    return {
      currentUsers: analysis.activeUsers,
      currentTraffic: analysis.requestsPerDay,
      existingIntegrations: analysis.integrations,
      estimatedDowntime: '0 seconds', // Zero-downtime migration
      migrationSteps: [
        'Purchase custom domain',
        'Configure DNS',
        'Test custom domain',
        'Enable redirects',
        'Update documentation',
        'Notify users (optional)',
        'Monitor traffic'
      ],
      estimatedDuration: '30 minutes',
      reversible: true
    };
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Execute Zero-Downtime Migration

```bash
# Purchase and configure custom domain
$ builder-domains upgrade my-app \
  --to myapp.com \
  --preserve-old-domain \
  --auto-redirect \
  --migration-strategy gradual

Upgrade Plan:
├── Purchase domain: myapp.com
├── Configure DNS automatically
├── Provision SSL certificate
├── Test custom domain
├── Enable redirect: my-app.build → myapp.com
├── Gradual traffic migration: 10% → 50% → 100%
└── Monitor for issues

Proceed? (y/n): y

✓ Domain purchased: myapp.com
✓ DNS configured
✓ SSL active
✓ Testing... all tests passed
✓ Redirect enabled (301)
✓ Traffic migration: 10%...

Monitoring traffic for 1 hour...

✓ Traffic migration: 50%...
✓ Traffic migration: 100%

Migration complete!
- New domain: https://myapp.com
- Old domain: Redirects to new (will maintain for 90 days)
- Downtime: 0 seconds
```

### Step 3: Update Integrations

```typescript
// Automated integration updates
async function updateIntegrations(oldDomain: string, newDomain: string) {
  const integrations = await getIntegrations(oldDomain);

  for (const integration of integrations) {
    switch (integration.type) {
      case 'oauth':
        await updateOAuthRedirects(integration, newDomain);
        break;

      case 'webhook':
        // Keep old webhooks working during transition
        await addWebhookEndpoint(integration, newDomain);
        break;

      case 'api_key':
        // API keys work with both domains during transition
        await enableDualDomain(integration);
        break;

      case 'embed':
        // Provide migration guide for embeds
        await generateEmbedMigrationGuide(integration, newDomain);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Update Documentation

```markdown
# Automatic documentation update

## Migration Notice

We've upgraded to our custom domain!

**Old URL:** https://my-app.build (redirects automatically)
**New URL:** https://myapp.com

### What you need to do:
- **Web users:** Nothing! Automatic redirect
- **API users:** Update base URL from `my-app.build` to `myapp.com`
- **OAuth apps:** Update redirect URLs in your OAuth settings
- **Webhooks:** Update to new domain (old domain supported for 90 days)

### Migration timeline:
- **Now:** Both domains work
- **Next 90 days:** Gradual transition
- **After 90 days:** Old domain redirects permanently
```

### Step 5: Monitor Migration

```typescript
class MigrationMonitor {
  async monitorUpgrade(oldDomain: string, newDomain: string) {
    const metrics = {
      oldDomainTraffic: [],
      newDomainTraffic: [],
      errors: [],
      redirects: []
    };

    // Monitor for 7 days
    for (let day = 0; day < 7; day++) {
      const dailyMetrics = await getDailyMetrics({
        oldDomain,
        newDomain
      });

      metrics.oldDomainTraffic.push(dailyMetrics.old.requests);
      metrics.newDomainTraffic.push(dailyMetrics.new.requests);
      metrics.errors.push(dailyMetrics.errors);
      metrics.redirects.push(dailyMetrics.redirects);

      // Alert on issues
      if (dailyMetrics.errors > 100) {
        await alert('High error rate during migration');
      }

      if (dailyMetrics.old.requests > dailyMetrics.new.requests * 2) {
        await alert('Users not migrating to new domain');
      }
    }

    return metrics;
  }
}
```

## Upgrade Strategies

### Strategy 1: Instant Cutover

```typescript
// Best for: Small user base, no critical integrations
await builderDomains.upgrade({
  from: 'my-app.build',
  to: 'myapp.com',
  strategy: 'instant',
  redirect: true
});

// Old domain redirects immediately
// Single point of migration
```

**Pros:**
- Simple
- Fast
- Clean cutover

**Cons:**
- Potential breaking changes for API users
- No rollback window

### Strategy 2: Gradual Migration

```typescript
// Best for: Larger user base, critical applications
await builderDomains.upgrade({
  from: 'my-app.build',
  to: 'myapp.com',
  strategy: 'gradual',
  phases: [
    { percent: 10, duration: '24h' },
    { percent: 50, duration: '48h' },
    { percent: 100, duration: 'forever' }
  ]
});

// Traffic gradually shifts
// Monitor each phase
```

**Pros:**
- Safe
- Monitorable
- Rollback possible

**Cons:**
- Takes longer
- More complex

### Strategy 3: Dual-Running

```typescript
// Best for: Enterprise applications, zero tolerance for issues
await builderDomains.upgrade({
  from: 'my-app.build',
  to: 'myapp.com',
  strategy: 'dual',
  duration: '90d'
});

// Both domains fully functional
// Users migrate at their own pace
```

**Pros:**
- Zero breaking changes
- Users self-migrate
- Maximum safety

**Cons:**
- Maintain two domains
- Longer transition
- Higher cost during transition

## Communication Strategy

### Before Upgrade

```typescript
// Notify users of upcoming change
async function announceUpgrade() {
  await sendEmail({
    to: allUsers,
    subject: 'Exciting news: We\'re getting a custom domain!',
    body: `
      We're upgrading to myapp.com!

      What this means for you:
      - Better branding
      - Easier to remember
      - Same great product

      Timeline:
      - April 1: New domain goes live
      - April 1-30: Both domains work
      - May 1: Automatic redirect from old domain

      Action needed:
      - Web users: None (automatic redirect)
      - API users: Update to myapp.com before May 1
      - OAuth apps: Update redirect URLs

      Questions? Reply to this email.
    `
  });

  await postBlog({
    title: 'Upgrading to myapp.com',
    content: `
      Detailed migration guide...
      FAQ...
      Support contact...
    `
  });
}
```

### During Upgrade

```typescript
// Real-time status
await updateStatusPage({
  status: 'migrating',
  message: 'Domain upgrade in progress - no expected downtime',
  updates: [
    { time: '10:00', message: 'Starting migration' },
    { time: '10:05', message: 'DNS configured' },
    { time: '10:10', message: 'SSL active' },
    { time: '10:15', message: 'Traffic migration: 10%' },
    { time: '10:30', message: 'Traffic migration: 50%' },
    { time: '11:00', message: 'Traffic migration: 100%' },
    { time: '11:05', message: 'Migration complete!' }
  ]
});
```

### After Upgrade

```typescript
// Success announcement
await sendEmail({
  to: allUsers,
  subject: 'We\'ve moved to myapp.com!',
  body: `
    Our domain upgrade is complete!

    New URL: https://myapp.com

    Everything is working normally. If you bookmarked the old domain,
    it will automatically redirect.

    For API users: Please update your base URL to myapp.com

    Thank you for your patience!
  `
});
```

## Cost Analysis

### ROI Calculator

```typescript
interface UpgradeROI {
  costs: {
    domain: 12,           // Annual domain registration
    time: 50,             // Setup time (1 hour @ $50/hr)
    communication: 20,    // Email campaigns, etc
    total: 82
  },

  benefits: {
    branding: 1000,       // Estimated brand value increase
    credibility: 500,     // Easier to close deals
    seo: 200,             // Better search rankings
    retention: 300,       // Users take you more seriously
    total: 2000
  },

  roi: (2000 - 82) / 82, // 2,239% ROI
  paybackPeriod: '1 week'
}
```

### When NOT to Upgrade

```typescript
const dontUpgradeIf = {
  noUsers: true,              // < 10 active users
  noRevenue: true,            // $0 revenue
  stillPivoting: true,        // Changing direction frequently
  multipleProjects: true,     // Testing many ideas
  temporaryProject: true,     // Short-term experiment

  // Better to spend money on:
  betterUse: [
    'Customer acquisition',
    'Product development',
    'Team hiring'
  ]
};
```

## Advanced Upgrade Patterns

### Multi-Brand Strategy

```typescript
// One product, multiple brands
await builderDomains.upgrade({
  from: 'my-app.build',
  to: [
    { domain: 'myapp.com', region: 'US', default: true },
    { domain: 'myapp.co.uk', region: 'UK' },
    { domain: 'myapp.de', region: 'DE' }
  ],
  routing: 'geo-aware'
});

// Users automatically routed to regional domain
```

### White-Label Upgrades

```typescript
// Customers get their own domains
async function enableWhiteLabel(customer) {
  await builderDomains.addCustomerDomain({
    customer: customer.id,
    domain: customer.customDomain, // app.customer.com
    baseDomain: 'my-app.build',
    sslManagement: 'automatic'
  });

  // Customer accesses via their domain
  // Powered by your infrastructure
}
```

## Conclusion

The upgrade path from free to custom domains should be:

- **Frictionless:** Zero downtime, automatic migration
- **Reversible:** Can roll back if issues
- **Gradual:** Option for phased migration
- **Communicative:** Keep users informed
- **Value-driven:** Upgrade when it makes business sense
