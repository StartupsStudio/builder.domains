# Builder Domains

## Hero

<Hero
  badge="Zero Friction"
  title="Free Domains. Instant Setup. Ship Faster."
  subtitle="Get a professional domain for your project in seconds. No registration, no DNS configuration, no credit card required."
  primaryCTA={{ label: "Claim Your Domain", href: "/claim" }}
  secondaryCTA={{ label: "Check Availability", href: "/check" }}

## Domain Search

<DomainSearch

  tlds={[".build", ".dev.build", ".demo.build", ".api.build"]}

## Problem

<Section variant="problem">

### Domain Setup Kills Momentum

Every time you start a project, the same friction:

- **Registration forms** — Email, password, payment info
- **DNS configuration** — A records, CNAME, nameservers
- **SSL certificates** — Provisioning, renewal, configuration
- **Propagation delays** — Wait 24-48 hours for DNS
- **Renewal fees** — Pay annually for domains you might abandon

By the time your domain is ready, your motivation is gone.

</Section>

## Solution

<Section variant="solution">

### One Command. Live Domain.

```bash
npx builder.domains claim myproject
```

```
✓ Domain claimed: myproject.build
✓ SSL certificate provisioned
✓ Ready to connect

Your domain is live at https://myproject.build
```

That's it. No forms. No waiting. No payment.

## FAQ

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Are these real domains?",
      answer: "Yes! Builder domains are fully functional domains with proper DNS resolution and SSL certificates. They work exactly like any other domain on the internet."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the catch?",
      answer: "No catch. Free tier domains use our builder TLDs (like .build). If you want a custom TLD (like .com), you can upgrade through our platform or any registrar."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use these for production?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Many builders use builder.domains for production sites. When you're ready for a custom domain, our upgrade path makes migration seamless."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I stop using a domain?",
      answer: "Inactive domains are released after 30 days of no traffic. You'll get a warning email before release. Active domains are yours as long as you're using them."
    },
    {
      question: "Can AI agents use this?",
      answer: "Yes! Our API is designed for programmatic access. AI agents can claim domains, configure DNS, and manage SSL without any human intervention."
